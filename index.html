    <h3 class="headline">How the executive would affect (some of) your town's grants</h3>

    <div class="explainer">Search for your town to the see how statutory
      grants would change from Fiscal 2017 levels to levels set out in
      Gov. Dannel Malloy's executive order budget, which dictates how the
      state will spend money in the absence of an approved
      budget. Statutory municipal grants made up 2.4 billion in 2017, a
      number that would be cut to 1.8 billion under the governor's
      executive order. There
      are other types of grants, worth about XX, not included here because
      the amounts are dictated by XX,
      not state statute, and no dollar value is given in the executive order.
      The
      executive order budget document is
